//! # Myco

//! "Myco" is a Rust library that enhances user anonymity in encrypted messaging by hiding metadata 
//! like communication timing and participant relationships. It uses an innovative data structure 
//! inspired by ORAM to achieve efficient read and write operations, while maintaining strong 
//! cryptographic guarantees. By separating message writing and reading across two servers, Myco 
//! significantly improves performance compared to existing systems.
